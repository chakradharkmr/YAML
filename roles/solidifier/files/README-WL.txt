AFTERCARE INSTRUCTIONS FOR WL ROLE.

The following tasks still need to be done manually:
1. 	Under the /option folder there are some optional whitelisting exclusions available. 
	These exclusions are not automatically run by this role. 
	Verify if these exclusions need to be run on this server. 

Feel free to use this file as a checklist and don't forget to delete after.
